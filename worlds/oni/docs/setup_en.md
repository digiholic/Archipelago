## Configuring your YAML file

### What is a YAML file and why do I need one?

Your YAML file contains a set of configuration options which provide the generator with information about how it should
generate your game. Each player of a multiworld will provide their own YAML file. This setup allows each player to enjoy
an experience customized for their taste, and different players in the same multiworld can all have different options.

### Where do I get a YAML file?

You can customize your settings by visiting the 
[Old School Runescape Player Settings Page](/games/Old%20School%20Runescape/player-settings)

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

### Install the Archipelago Not Included Mod

### Add your AP-Generated.json file to the Mod Directory
